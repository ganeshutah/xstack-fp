(Figure from CACM February 2021, ``Keeping Science on Keel when Software Moves.'': A three-dimensional, undirected representation of the example from Figure 6. Nodes are colored by community membership and sized based on a threshold centrality value. The red nodes represent model variables sensitive to specific CPU instructions. All nodes with eigenvector centrality â‰¤ 0.4 have a constant size, and those above the threshold are scaled and highlighted by increased reflectance. Credit: Liam Krauss of LLNL.)
