  title: 'FLiT: Floating-Point Litmus Tester - reproducibility testing framework'
  author: Michael Bentley, Geof Sawaya, Ian Briggs
  url: https://github.com/PRUNERS/FLiT
  # crossref={flit, bentley},
  abstract: FLiT is a reproducibility testing framework for floating-point algorithms under different compilers and optimizations

Herbie: 
  title:[Automatically Improving Accuracy for Floating Point Expressions](http://herbie.uwplse.org/pldi15-paper.pdf)
  author: Pavel Panchekha, Alex Sanchez-Stern, David Thien, Zachary Tatlock, Jason Qiu, Jack Firth, and James R. Wilcox

  #crossref={}
  abstract: Herbie detects inaccurate expressions and finds more accurate replacements.

SATIRE: 
  title:[SATIRE: Scalable Abstraction-guided Technique for Incremental Rigorous analysis of round-off Errors](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10294504)
  author: Pavel Panchekha, Alex Sanchez-Stern, David Thien, Zachary Tatlock, Jason Qiu, Jack Firth, and James R. Wilcox
  url:https://github.com/arnabd88/Satire
  #crossref={}
  abstract: Satire is a first order error analysis tool for obtaining rigorous bounds on worst case floating point round-off errors. It works on straight line floating-point programs.

Seesaw: 
  title:SEESAW: Scalable Error Analysis of Conditional Floating Point Programs
  author:Arnab Das, Ian Briggs, Ganesh Gopalakrishnan, Sriram Krishnamoorthy, Pavel Panchekha
  url:https://github.com/arnabd88/Seesaw
  #crossref={}
  abstract: Seesaw similar to its predecessor Satire is a first order error analysis tool for obtaining rigorous bounds on worst case floating point round-off errors. But unlike Satire, Seesaw works on floating-point programs WITH conditions.
