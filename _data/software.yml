BinFPE:
  title: "BinFPE: Detecting floating-point exceptions in NVIDIA GPU applications."
  author: Ignacio Laguna
  repo: https://github.com/LLNL/BinFPE
  abstract: BinFPE is a tool that detects floating-point exceptions (NaN, infinity, and subnormal quantities) in NVIDIA GPU applications using binary instrumentation. It requires no re-compilation of the application and can analyze libraries. The tool extends NVBit, which is provided by NVIDIA Labs to analyze binaries. We provide a patch to NVBit to build BinFPE.

flit:
  title: "FLiT: Floating-Point Litmus Tester - reproducibility testing framework"
  author: Michael Bentley, Geof Sawaya, Ian Briggs
  repo: https://github.com/PRUNERS/FLiT
  abstract: FLiT is a reproducibility testing framework for floating-point algorithms under different compilers and optimizations

Herbie:
  title: "Herbie: Automatically Improving Accuracy for Floating Point Expressions"
  author: Pavel Panchekha, Alex Sanchez-Stern, David Thien, Zachary Tatlock, Jason Qiu, Jack Firth, and James R. Wilcox
  url: http://herbie.uwplse.org/
  link:
    docs: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2737924.2737959
  abstract: Herbie detects inaccurate expressions and finds more accurate replacements.

SATIRE:
  title: "SATIRE: Scalable Abstraction-guided Technique for Incremental Rigorous analysis of round-off Errors"
  author: Arnab Das, Ian Briggs, Ganesh Gopalakrishnan, Sriram Krishnamoorthy, Pavel Panchekha
  repo: https://github.com/arnabd88/Satire
  link:
    docs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11960.pdf
  abstract: Satire is a first order error analysis tool for obtaining rigorous bounds on worst case floating point round-off errors. It works on straight line floating-point programs.

Seesaw:
  title: "SEESAW: Scalable Error Analysis of Conditional Floating Point Programs"
  author: Arnab Das, Tanmay Tirpankar, Ganesh Gopalakrishnan, Sriram Krishnamoorthy
  repo: https://github.com/arnabd88/Seesaw
  link:
    docs: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9556024/authors
  abstract: Seesaw similar to its predecessor Satire is a first order error analysis tool for obtaining rigorous bounds on worst case floating point round-off errors. But unlike Satire, Seesaw works on floating-point programs WITH conditions.

FPChecker:
  title: "FPChecker: Detecting Floating-point Exceptions in GPU Applications"
  author: Ignacio Laguna
  url: https://fpchecker.org/
  repo: https://github.com/LLNL/FPChecker
  abstract: FPChecker is a dynamic analysis tool to detect floating-point errors in HPC applications.
