#   your GitHub usernames, as they are guaranteed to be unique and will also
#   match up with the git logs. 
#  Please fill out all required fields 
#   (indicated in the template by not being double commented out),
#   and whatever other fields you feel comfortable doing.
#  For more information about the fields please check out
