# <<                            TEMPLATE CONFIG                              >> 
# << ======================================================================= >> 
# This is the Jekyll build config file.
# Much of this should only be touched if you know what you are doing !!
# That being said the first two sections are set up for you to be able to fill out easily,
#  and you will need to fill out at least the first section to get this to work !!

# << ========================== Required Section =========================== >> 
# this is displayed on the page header of every page & in the page metadata.
title: "X-Stack FP: ComPort"
# this is displayed on the about page
bio:                ...for showing good ComPort by ensuring that numerically-intense code can be reliably ported across heterogeneous hardware and software
# this is displayed on the about page & in the page metadata
description: "Website for the DOE X-Stack award for reliable software addressing upcoming machines"

# The location & language information for the site (part of the site metadata)
locale:             en_US

# These next two fields will depend on how you are hosting the webpage.
# If you plan to build locally you might need to fill them in with the proper info 
#  to get links ot build correctly, across the entire site.
# This is also true if you want to build locally but still host on GitHub Pages. 
#  see https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites
# However if you plan to build and host on GitHub Pages you are fine to leave these commented out as GitHub compensates.
# url:                "https://osterhoutan-UofU.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site #! Replace me later
# baseurl:            "comweb" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog #! will likely need replace me latter too


# << ========================== Optional Section =========================== >> 
# This section has information that will add to the website 
#  and make it seem more professional.
# Sections of importance will have descriptions,
#  but most should be self explanatory.
# To activate a section uncomment it, and the relevant subsections, 
#   or if the value is set to false, change the value to your desired value (not to true).
# To de-activate a section comment it out, and the relevant subsections.

# This section will display useful links at the bottom of the page to useful resources.
links: 
  docs:             false # URL to page containing documentation for one thing or another (this will also be added to the nav bar)

  bitbucket:        false # bitbucket user or org name
  repo:             false # URL to other repo system that you use (this is a catch all)
  reddit:           false # sub-reddit name (prepend "r/" for sub-reddit or "u/" for a user)
  forum:            false # URL to a help forum (i.e. repo issues page or an actual forum)
